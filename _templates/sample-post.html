    Some untagged line in the body followed by line break tag. <br />
    <h1>Heading 1</h1>
    <h2>Heading 2</h2>
    <h3>Heading 3</h3>
    <h4>Heading 4</h4>
    <h5>Heading 5</h5>
    <h1 class="center-content">Centered Heading 1</h1>
    <p>
        Paragraph looks like this. That aside, the question that comes is <q>Who is better? Batman or Superman.</q>
        My answer really depends on which Batman and which Superman are we talking about. If there is no 
        specification then I'll go with Batman. If it is Nolan's dark knight vs any superman, then I'll go 
        with Batman. If it is any other Batman vs Snyder's Superman, then I'll go with Superman.Thats it I guess.
